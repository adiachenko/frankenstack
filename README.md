# Frankenstack

Running Laravel on **FrankenPHP** is fast — but the setup can get fiddly.

Frankenstack gives you a single, Laravel-ready Docker image that supports:

- 🧱 **classic** (FPM-style) request-per-boot execution
- ⚡️ **worker** (Laravel Octane) mode for high-throughput apps

Batteries included with sensible defaults, configurable via environment variables.
